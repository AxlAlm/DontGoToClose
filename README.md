# FastestPath

FastestPath is a tiny little project to visualize path finding algorithms in a setting where the closer to an obstacle you are the slower you can travel!


# How to run

Note! Currently, there is only support for example1 map and Djikstra algorithm

    python run.py -map example1 -max_distance 5 -show_distance -penalty_cost 5 -algo Djikstra
